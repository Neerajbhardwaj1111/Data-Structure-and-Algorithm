## ARRAY

1. **Pair with the given Sum** : Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, check if there exists a pair whose sum equals the target
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** : Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.
3. **Find duplicates in O(n) time** : Given an array arr[] of n elements that contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. The task is to find the repeating numbers.
4. **Product of Array Except Self** : Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a product array res[] (of the same size) such that res[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i].
5. **Maximum Subarray** : Given an integer array arr[], find the subarray (containing at least one element) which has the maximum possible sum, and return that sum.
6. **Maximum Product Subarray** : Given an array arr[] consisting of positive, negative, and zero values, find the maximum product that can be obtained from any contiguous subarray of arr[].
7. **Minimum in Rotated Sorted** : Given a sorted array of distinct elements arr[] of size n that is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.
8. **Search in Rotated Sorted** : Given a sorted and rotated array arr[] of distinct elements, find the index of given key in the array. If the key is not present in the array, return -1.
9. **3 Sum** : Given an array arr[], the task is to find all possible indices {i, j, k} of triplet {arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]} such that their sum is equal to zero and all indices in a triplet should be distinct (i != j, j != k, k != i). We need to return indices of a triplet in sorted order, i.e., i < j < k.
10. **Container With Most Water** : Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.
11. **Trapping Rain Water Problem** : Given an array arr[] of size n consisting of non-negative integers, where each element represents the height of a bar in an elevation map and the width of each bar is 1, determine the total amount of water that can be trapped between the bars after it rains.
12. **Merge Overlapping Intervals** : Given an array of time intervals where arr[i] = [starti, endi], our task is to merge all the overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals.
13. **Non-overlapping intervals in an array** : Given a 2d array arr[][] of time intervals, where each interval is of the form [start, end]. The task is to determine all intervals from the given array that do not overlap with any other interval in the set. If no such interval exists, return an empty list.

## MATRIX

14. **Set Matrix Zeroes** : Given a boolean matrix mat where each cell contains either 0 or 1, the task is to modify it such that if a matrix cell matrix[i][j] is 1 then all the cells in its ith row and jth column will become 1.
15. **Spiral Matrix** : Given a matrix mat[][] of size m x n, the task is to print all elements of the matrix in spiral form.
16. **Program to find transpose of a matrix** : Given a 2D matrix mat[][], compute its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is formed by converting all rows of mat[][] into columns and all columns into rows.

## STRING

17. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** : Given a string s having lowercase characters, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
