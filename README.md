## ARRAY

1. **Pair with the given Sum** : Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, check if there exists a pair whose sum equals the target
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** : Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.
