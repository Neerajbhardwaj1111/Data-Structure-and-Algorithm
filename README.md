## ARRAY

1. **Pair with the given Sum** : Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, check if there exists a pair whose sum equals the target
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** : Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.
3. **Find duplicates in O(n) time** : Given an array arr[] of n elements that contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. The task is to find the repeating numbers.
4. **Product of Array Except Self** : Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a product array res[] (of the same size) such that res[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i].
5. **Maximum Subarray** : Given an integer array arr[], find the subarray (containing at least one element) which has the maximum possible sum, and return that sum.
6. **Maximum Product Subarray** : Given an array arr[] consisting of positive, negative, and zero values, find the maximum product that can be obtained from any contiguous subarray of arr[].
7. **Minimum in Rotated Sorted** : Given a sorted array of distinct elements arr[] of size n that is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.
8. **Search in Rotated Sorted** : Given a sorted and rotated array arr[] of distinct elements, find the index of given key in the array. If the key is not present in the array, return -1.
9. **3 Sum** : Given an array arr[], the task is to find all possible indices {i, j, k} of triplet {arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]} such that their sum is equal to zero and all indices in a triplet should be distinct (i != j, j != k, k != i). We need to return indices of a triplet in sorted order, i.e., i < j < k.
10. **Container With Most Water** : Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.
